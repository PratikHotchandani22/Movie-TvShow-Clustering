The goal of this project is to cluster movies based on similarities in their plot summaries using unsupervised learning techniques. The clusters will help identify hidden genres, themes, or trends across movies that go beyond traditional labels. By analyzing plot summaries, we can group movies with similar storylines and underlying themes, enabling insights into new genres and connections between films.
